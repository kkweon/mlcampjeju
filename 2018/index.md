- You will be provided full accommodation support, **1,000 USD stipend**, and up to **300 USD support** for flights to Jeju
- You will be provided **xxx Google Cloud credits**, to use to train your models

## How does this work?

- All applicants will suggest a research topic, which will be reviewed and selected by mentors and organizers
    ([See topics from 2017](https://github.com/TensorFlowKR/mlcampjeju/blob/master/2017/github/04_FinalPresentation.md))
- Each participant will work on the topic for one month pre-camp, with support from a mentor
- Each participant will work on the topic for one month on-site, at Jeju
- At the end of the camp, each participant will be expected to release project results as follows:
    1. Present final results at presentation day of the camp

# FAQ

1. Can I propose more than one project?
    - Sure! Just include both topics in your application.
1. Can I apply as a team?
    - We value teamwork, but are currently seeking for individual participants.
1. Can I join the camp with my own money if my proposal is not selected?
    - No, becuase we have limited space, but you may consider applying to the Deep learning summer school and/or hackathon which will have separate application processes.
1. Will datasets be provided?
    - No, the participant should prepare their own datasets.
1. Can we just implement previously existing models, or should we have new ideas?
    - It's okay to just do an implemention of a model, but it is definitely preferred to have an idea to improve that model, or build a real-life application using that model.
1. Am I allowed to bring a parter?
    - Unfortunately we only provide accommodations for the participants. You can book your own accommodations if you wish to stay with your partner during the camp.
1. Are there restrictions to licenses of the to-be-released open source code?
    - An MIT licence is recommended, but can be changed with your mentor's consent.
1. Are there restrictions to authorship of the to-be-released technical paper?
    - The paper should include you and your mentor, but can be extended with your mentor's consent.
