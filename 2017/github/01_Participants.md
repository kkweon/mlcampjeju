# Participants of Machine Learning Camp Jeju 2017

We are very pleased to inform that 20 participants have been successfully selected for the ML CAMP Jeju 2017. This year, the competition was really strong: we received a total of 633 applications and only 20 were selected. Once again, we really congratulate the 20 participants and would like to introduce them.

We will also update the progress and all results/implemenations will be related in Github.
